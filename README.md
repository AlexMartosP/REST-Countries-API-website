## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned so much from this challenge. It really tested my knowledge about fetching APIs and creating a good user experience when searching and/or filtering.

I also took this opportunity to test out my React Context skills and I learnt very much from it.

I think this useFetch hook is the most complex useFetch hook i have built.
All feedback on that hook and everything else are welcome!
If you see an opportunity to more efficient fetch I would love to know.
Also, if you have any tips to improve my use of styled-components I would love to hear, I am fairly new on using it :)
